//Given a number represented by a list of digits, find the next greater permutation of a number,
// in terms of lexicographic ordering.
// If there is not greater permutation possible, return the permutation with the lowest value/ordering.
//
//For example, the list [1,2,3] should return [1,3,2]. The list [1,3,2] should return [2,1,3].
// The list [3,2,1] should return [1,2,3].



//With an array of numbers, determine position of last ascending digit and call it p

//With an array of numbers, determine position of last digit greater than [p]

//With an array of numbers, if there is more than 1 digit after position p, reverse the digits after position p
